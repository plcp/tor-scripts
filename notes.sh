# --purge-cache purges the cache (same as rm -rf .lighttor-cache.d
# --static path:root serves files in path to url prefix root
#
# for example, we have:
# --static ./js-client/demo/:
#   :- now ./js-client/demo/lighttor.bundle.js is at /lighttor.bundle.js
# --static ./js-client/evaluation/:
#   :- now ./js-client/evaluation/per-message.html is at /per-message.html
# --static ./js-client/demo/.dev/:.dev
#   :- now ./js-client/demo/.dev/io.js is at /.dev/io.sh
#
# you have several .html files with different demos, and a ".dev.html" one:
#  - when using minified versions, you can't debug shit
#  - adding "./js-client/demo/.dev/:.dev" serves source as static files
#  - headers in ".dev.html" can be used to includes everything in order
#  - now, you can debug shit in your demos

#
# the fast channel creation sends a shorter ntor handshake where the identity

# with open, the client first GET /guard then opens the channel, hence slower
# with fast, the client creates a channel in one query

#  - copy the content of bronion/.lighttor-auth.d/suffix
#  - paste it
#
# the auth channel creation implies fast channel creation.
# the auth channel creation sends along the request an extra public key, the
# proxy ntor handshakes with the extra public key, it uses the derived shared
# secret to encrypt the answer. The client verify the auth and decrpt.
