Roadmap python implementation:
 - download consensus via HTTP whenever possible
 - asyncio-only (sans-IO?) rewrite of core components
 - websockets-only (no flask, perform_request-based) rewrite of the proxy
 - link authentication
 - consensus signatures
 - descriptor signatures
 - handle more crypto bits in C? wrapped ctor?
 - remove complexity/bottlenecks (no parsers? no cell.view? proper zlib & peel)

Roadmap javascript implementation:
 - add configurable path (override the proxy-provided one)
 - add url suffix parser (guard node, path spec, proxy auth)
 - remove sjcl, use native SubtleCrypto instead
 - remove nacl, use HACL* Curve25519 build in WebAssembly instead

Roadmap common:
 - pluggable transport+proxy websocket-only approach (maybe .extra/spec.txt)
 - a nginx proxy integration

Roadmap common:
 - use raw consensus & descriptors instead of JSON-ified ones? (client parsers)

Roadmap path selection:
 - replace '/guard' by '/guards' (let clients choose their guard?)
 - more static guards? (they shouldn't change much often)
 - implement ABWRS in python
 - ...and in javascript
 - add a '/paths' endpoint that spits out bunch of paths

Roadmap javascript implementation:
 - provide a XMLHttpRequest override? websocket override? (unsafe)
