Roadmap common:   
 - replace '/guard' by '/guards' (let clients choose their guard)
 - use raw consensus & descriptors instead of JSON-ified ones? (client parsers)

Roadmap python implementation:
 - download consensus via HTTP whenever possible
 - asyncio-only (sans-IO?) rewrite of core components
 - websockets-only (no flask, perform_request-based) rewrite of the proxy
 - link authentication
 - consensus signatures
 - descriptor signatures
 - proper path selection algorithm
 - handle more crypto bits in C? wrapped ctor?
 - remove complexity/bottlenecks (no parsers? no cell.view? proper zlib & peel)
