 - DIGEST_LEN?
 - HASH_LEN ambiguous in 5.2.2
 - how digests are computed
    - it's only on onion-encrypted data
 - which timezone is used
    - as expected, UTC (but unspecified)
 - source code says:
    /* We don't currently allow EXTEND2 cells without an IPv4 address */
    ...but the spec doesn't say that!
 - source code enforce (in check_extend_cell):  
    if (tor_digest_is_zero((const char*)cell->node_id))
    ...implying that an EXTEND2 cell without a Legacy identity is invalid...
    ...but the spec doesn't say that!
